    '''Hi! Welcome to the Wound Up! tutorial. You can navigate through this '''
    '''tutorial by clicking the left and right arrows just above. Press the '''
    '''cross at any time to close it.''',
    
    '''You embody the racial consciousness of a tribe of elves. It is your '''
    '''charge, your sacred duty to lead your children to a life of safety '''
    '''and prosperity.''',

    '''However, an evil mastermind, by the name of Dr Bucket McEvilpants, '''
    '''with an axe to grind has kidnapped some of your elves and deviously '''
    '''imprisoned them inside his clockwork gumball machines!''',

    '''For the sake of all things you must recover your elf-folk: but your '''
    '''resources are limited, and time is the most precious of them all.''',
    
    '''The objective of this game is to rescue elves from their imprisonment '''
    '''inside gumball machines. You can achieve this by connecting up your '''
    '''spring to the wheel on the gumball machines and turning it.''',

    '''However, you will need judicious use of cogs and belts and various '''
    '''machines in order to do this. As elves are freed they will join you '''
    '''and help by winding up the spring or placing cogs, platforms, belts '''
    '''and ladders all in pursuit of ultimate liberation of the elven tribe.''',
    
    '''1) Hover the mouse over game objects and look at the text that '''
    '''appears in the lower right. This is the status area, all sorts '''
    '''of useful (and some less useful) information will appear here.''',

    '''2) Hover the mouse over the buttons in the lower left and look '''
    '''at the descriptions in the status area. Click on a cog button '''
    '''and move the cursor over the game area.''',

    '''3) If the cursor is red then the target area is blocked. Try '''
    '''placing a cog above the spring; a cog template will appear to '''
    '''indicate that the task is scheduled.''',

    '''4) Now click on the ladder button and drag a ladder down from '''
    '''the centre of the cog template to the floor. Elves should now '''
    '''go to build the ladder and cog.''',

    '''5) Next drag a belt from the newly built cog to the wheel on '''
    '''the spring. Your elves will drag the belt out and attach it. '''
    '''Click the "+" button twice to move your elves to the spring '''
    '''and watch the wheels turn!''',

    '''6) Note the rubber and metal plants. As they work their efficiency '''
    '''will drop. So always be sure to push towards new factories. Throughout '''
    '''the game you may find new things, just experiment and find out what '''
    '''does what.''',
    
    '''7a) To complete the level, amass some metal and rubber and press "-" '''
    '''to get elves out of the spring. Build some cogs next to your first '''
    '''one out towards the gumball machine on the upper platform. Once you '''
    '''are close enough, build up to the platform and stretch a belt to the '''
    '''machine from your cog.''',

    '''7b) Once the gumball machine is connected, move your elves back to '''
    '''the spring and wait. Soon elves will be freed from the gumballs and '''
    '''you can then direct them to the spring to accelerate work. Once all '''
    '''elves are freed you have won!'''
