ABOUT THE GAME:
You embody the racial consciousness of a tribe of elves. It is your charge, your sacred duty to lead your children to a life of safety and prosperity. However, an evil mastermind, by the name of Dr Bucket McEvilpants, with an axe to grind has kidnapped some of your elves and deviously imprisoned them inside his clockwork gumball machines! For the sake of all things you must recover your elf-folk: but your resources are limited, and time is the most precious of them all.

The objective of this game is to rescue elves from their imprisonment inside gumball machines. You can achieve this by connecting up your spring to the wheel on the gumball machines and turning it. However, you will need judicious use of cogs and belts and various machines in order to do this. As elves are freed they will join you and help by winding up the spring or placing cogs, platforms, belts and ladders all in pursuit of ultimate liberation of the elven tribe. Viva la Revolution.

Try your best to rescue your elf-folk as fast as you can, thus earning your position amongst the greatest

KNOWN BUGS:
On less powerful systems, dropped frames can cause a pronounced flickering. We suggest running with particles disabled (using the --no-particles command line switch) if this is a problem.
