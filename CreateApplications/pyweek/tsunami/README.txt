DEPENDENCIES:

You need python 2.5, and a graphics card supported by Pyglet (this usually
means a good OpenGL support).

This game uses cocos and pyglet, which come bundled (and in fact, the versions
included are slightly modified)

RUNNING THE GAME:

On Windows or Mac OS X, locate the "run_game.pyw" file and double-click it.

Othewise open a terminal / console and "cd" to the game directory and run:

  python run_game.py



HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:

Race your submarines in the reef of the world for money! Winning races
gets you prizes, which allow you to buy faster/better submarines.

You pilot the red/pink submarine. Up arrows fires the propeller, left and
right turns. (You can also choose WASD controls in the prefs menu)

The 8 keys around S (on a qwerty keyboard) throw strings to objects that
might be in that direction (rocks, other subs, sunken ships, fish, etc).
If there is something in that direction, the string will grab to the
object and start pulling, until you release the key (which detachs the rope).
Otherwise nothing will happen

W fires the string at the front of the submarine, X to the back, and the
other keys in the relative directions. Using the pull of strings you can
go faster, dodge obstacles, slow down opponents or whatever you like. 

There is no mouse control.

Winning races will  unlock other tracks where you can race.
