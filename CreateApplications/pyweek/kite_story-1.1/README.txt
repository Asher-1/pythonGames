Kite Story
==========

Team entry "midnightsun" for PyWeek #7 (http://www.pyweek.org/7)

Requirements
------------

 * Python 2.5
 * One of:
   - Mac OS X 10.3 or later
   - Windows XP or later
   - Linux with GTK 2.2 (most distros will suffice)

To hear music, you will also need AVbin (http://code.google.com/p/avbin).

A current version of pyglet is included with this game, you do not need to
install it.

Playing the game
----------------

Instructions are provided in game when you choose the "Easy" menu option.

In case you need more instruction; here are the details.  The aim of the game
is to wrap your kite string around objects that appear.  You can direct the
kite with the mouse cursor (no clicking required after the menu).  You will
need to tighten the string completely around the object for it to get caught,
after which it will be attached to your kite string.

After catching three objects, your kite will grow and reach higher ground,
giving you access to more objects.  Collect another three and you can go
higher again, and so on ...

Avoid letting objects touch your kite's sail (the diamond shape).  If they do,
you will be temporarily disabled and will lose some of the objects attached to
your kite string.  When you are hit and have no more objects attached to your
string, you will drop down one level.

Objects early on in the game can be captured easily just by moving the mouse
around them.  Later objects will require you to predict their motion and avoid
the motion of other nearby objects.  Some fast-moving objects may require the
use of other objects to help shape your kite string.

If you can't catch an object, don't despair; just catch three other easier
objects to get past that level.

A more difficult "Challenge" mode is also provided, in which you are required
to collect one of every object on each level -- so you can't skip the tricky
ones.

There is a fun song and dance at the end of the game, if you make it that far.


Know issues
-----------

You will require an OpenGL-compatible graphics card and have 3D acceleration
enabled in your driver.  Some graphics cards or drivers have know issues;
check the pyglet FAQ if you are having trouble.

Please report any problems to the issue tracker at http://www.pyglet.org, or
mail me at Alex.Holkner@gmail.com.  Bug reports are highly valued as they are
the only way we find out where pyglet does not yet work.
