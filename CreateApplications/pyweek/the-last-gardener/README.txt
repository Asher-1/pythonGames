Requirements
------------

This game requires Python 2.7 to run. It will not work with Python 3.

Pyglet 1.2.4 is used, and it comes bundled with the game. In order to hear
the sound and music, you need to have AVBin installed.

AVBin can be downloaded from: https://avbin.github.io/AVbin/Download.html

Please ping Jjp137 in #pyweek on Freenode or comment on the diary entry if
there are any problems running the game.

Running the Game
----------------

On Windows or Mac OS X, locate the "run_game.pyw" file and double-click it.

Otherwise, open a terminal window, change to the game directory, and run:

  python run_game.py

To view the command line parameters for this game, specify the -h or --help
option. Most players won't need to use them.

The Story
---------

Aliens have taken over Earth and wiped out most of humanity, but lawns still
need to be mowed. You happen to be the only gardener remaining. Use your
lawn-mowing drones and mow the lawns in this lawn-mowing bullet hell game!

How to Play
-----------

Menu / story controls:
- Arrow keys: Move cursor / Change option
- Space or Enter: Select option / Advance story
- Escape: Go back / Skip story

Gameplay controls:
- Arrow keys: Move
- Shift: Focus (slow down)
- Escape: Pause

Other controls:
- Home: Take screenshot

During gameplay, move around with the arrow keys to mow the lawn while avoiding
bullets and enemies. Hold Shift to move slower and display your hitbox. You are
only hit by bullets if they collide with the hitbox. However, be careful not
to collide with enemies.

Mow the required percentage before you run out of lives or time in order to
win. If you have leftover time or lives, try going the extra mile and mow the
entire lawn. Those who want to test their skills should do so without getting
hit even once! You can retry a level as many times as you like.

There are three difficulty levels to choose from. To be honest, we're not
sure if beating all the levels on hard difficulty is possible :p
If you're not used to bullet hell games, we suggest playing on easy.

The game autosaves your progress in this folder. Delete save.dat before
launching the game if you wish to start over.

Known Issues
------------

- The game isn't as optimized as it could be, so you may experience slowdown,
particularly on older computers and when there are many bullets on screen.
