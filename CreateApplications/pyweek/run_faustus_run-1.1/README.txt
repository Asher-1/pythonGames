This game requires AVBin (http://avbin.github.io/AVbin/) to play music.


How to Play
===========

You are the wizard Faustus! In a moment of great hubris you bound yourself to
the demon Mephistopheles, and now you must struggle to escape from him!

  * W/A/D or arrow keys ley you move and jump.
  * Mouse lets you aim and cast spells.
  * Keys 1-4 change the currently selected spell.

While you run from Mephistopheles, you can collect scrolls. Each scroll you find
allows you to gain new spells or abilities. Select these from the "unlock" page
of the menu. You can select up to 4 of your unlocked spells to use in each
escape attempt.
