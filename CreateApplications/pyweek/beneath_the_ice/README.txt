Background Story:

A man sits in front of his igloo on top of an expansive glacier. He catches fish through a hole he has drilled into the ice. Sometimes he pulls up strange artefacts on his fishing line. He ponders over what lies in the deep, based on things he has fished out. He spends many weeks constructing a homemade submarine to find out.

The Game:

Explore the seafloor below your glacier .. use your trusty harpoon to grapple objects in the world, solve puzzles and make your way deeper. But something or someone is hiding in the murky depths, and they don't want to be found. They can`t let you in here. 

Controls:

Use the arrow keys to control your submarine. Use the z-key to fire and release your harpoon.
