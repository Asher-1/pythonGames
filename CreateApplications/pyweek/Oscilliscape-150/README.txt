DEPENDENCIES:

You might need to install some of these before running the game:

  Python:     http://www.python.org/
  pyglet:     http://www.pyglet.org/
  numpy:      http://numpy.scipy.org/



RUNNING THE GAME:

On Windows or Mac OS X, locate the "run_game.pyw" file and double-click it.

Othewise open a terminal / console and "cd" to the game directory and run:

  python run_game.py



HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:

Use the arrow keys: up and down adjust amplitude, left and right frequency.
(if you are running Linux you can use a joystick or gamepad too)
** If the frequency adjust feels backwards to you, set 
    
    reverse_frequency_keys = True

in gamelib/config.py and they will switch.


You ship has a shield system that recharges faster as your ship oscillates faster.

There are four levels, but if you find one of them too hard you can skip to the next level
by hitting Escape during a level, then starting the game again from the title screen.
