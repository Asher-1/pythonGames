This is reidrac's entry for PyWeek 17 (Sept 2013, theme: Moon).

Entry URL: http://pyweek.org/e/useboxnet4/

Post-compo updates: http://www.usebox.net/jjm/lunar/

You can play the game just running *lunar.py*.

I recommend you the *-f* flag to start the game in fullscreen mode, although
it might not work in your system!


Controls
========

The game can be controlled with the keyboard or a joystick/gamepad (this
can be configured in the game menu if a joystick is present).

Character movement:

  Keyboard: use the arrows for direction, 'z' for action.
  Joystick: use first button for action (usually 1 or A).

Other controls:

'esc'     skip screen, exit.
'p'       pause the game.

CTRL + f  change between windowed and full screen mode.


Requirements
============

You don't need to install the game, just run *lunar.py*. All the required
Python modules have been included in the package.

System requirements:

- OpenGL and at least 800x600 (windowed mode)
- Python 2.6 (or later, Python 3 not supported)
- AVbin (version 11 recommended)
- OpenAL (optional, recommended in Linux)
