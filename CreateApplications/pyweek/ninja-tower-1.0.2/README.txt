HOW TO PLAY THE GAME:

Ninja Tower is a two player action game.

Get the Heavenly Orb and defend it from the other player until your connection
to the Heavens is secured. Your connection is measured by a black bar on your
side. Make it reach the Heavens!

Controls for player 1 (on the left):

 * ASDW to move.
 * Q to slash.
 * 1 (one) to throw a ninja rope straight up.

Controls for player 2 (on the right):

 * Cursor keys to move.
 * / (forward slash) to slash.
 * . (period) to throw a ninja rope straight up.

Tips:

 * Master the double jump to reach great heights.
 * The rope goes straight up. Throw it from under something to get it hooked.
 * You can swing the rope. It's best if you throw it when you're already flying
   through the air.
 * The other guy got the Orb first? Whack him!
 * You cannot cut a block if it would cause the building (or part of it) to
   collapse. A master ninja uses this limitation to his advantage.
 * The mass of the tower wil stay roughly the same. To make it grow in one
   place cut off bits in another!
 * Want a rematch? Press ESC to restart the game!
