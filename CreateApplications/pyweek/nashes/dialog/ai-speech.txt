mode-none-patrolling {
    Got some patrolling to do
    Time to go to work
    This room isn't going to patrol itself
    Let's patrol this joint
}

mode-patrolling-going-to-rest {
    I'm feeling a bit tired
    Time for a rest I think
}

mode-patrolling-investigating {
    I'll respond to that
    What's going on over there?
    What was that?
    I'd better do something
    Responding!
    I'm on it!
    Got it covered!
}

mode-investigating-searching {
    Hmm, nothing here. I'll look around.
    Seems suspicious.
    I think I heard something over there!
    What's up with that?
    That wasn't nothing!
    Must have been something
}

mode-searching-none {
    Oh well. Must have been nothing.
    Hmm, nothing here now
    I can't find anything
    Doesn't make sense
    I'm chasing ghosts and spirits
}

mode-resting-investigating {
    It always happens when I'm asleep!
}

mode-patrolling-fixing {
    That's weird. This doesn't seem to be working.
    Hmm. Somebody turned this thing off.
    Why isn't this on?
    I'd better go fix this.
    That should be on!
    That doesn't look right to me
    Is that controller broken again?
}

mode-fixing-chasing {
    I've found him
    There's the culprit
    It was him all along
    He's going to pay for that
}

mode-investigating-chasing {
    Hold on - there he is!
    Wait, I think that's him!
    Why I never!
    Get 'im!
    Don't lose him now!
    You wont get away from me!
}

mode-switching-replacer {
    I'll replace you
    I guess I'll go and relieve him
}

mode-opening-door {
    Keycard!
    Swipe!
    Open sesame!
    Let me pass!
}

mode-arrived-to-fix-already-fixed {
    Oh, someone else must have fixed it
    It is working after all
    Hmm, gremlins in the system?
    It's already fixed
    Nothin for me to do here
}

mode-arrived-to-fix-fixed-it {
    That's better
    Done
    Got it working again
    Hmm, it's as simple as that
    All secure again now
    Now don't you turn off again!
}
