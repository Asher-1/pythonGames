History

This is my newest idea about font. This family is based on Celtic inscriptions
and Celtic-looking fonts, my old and new ideas and things
I once saw (but I don't know when...)
This work I dedicated to very important women in my life.
Klaudia is the first part of two fonts family. The second part is
Berenika. Both of these fonts are available in four weights: Book, Regular,
Demi and Bold.
